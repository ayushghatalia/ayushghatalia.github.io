<!-- **Shannon’s communication theory** comprises three levels: **technical, semantic, and effectiveness**. While the technical and semantic levels have made substantial progress, the effectiveness levels, involving **receiver behavior, has been largely unaddressed.**

The paper introduces **Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs)** to bridge this gap by reintroducing **behavior tokens** into LLM training data. These models demonstrate generalization capabilities in **simulating and explaining receiver behavior**, understanding content, and **adapting to various behavior domains** using the Content Behavior Corpus (CBC). -->
