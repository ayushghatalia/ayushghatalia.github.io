[[code & report]](https://github.com/ashmitkx/SAiDL-Spring-Assignment-2022/tree/main/3.%20Super%20Resolution) Developed a Convolutional Neural Network to **upscale low resolution images**, by a factor of ~2. Contrasted the performance of different model architecture designs, such as **CNNs, ResNets, Transposed Convolution, and SubPixel Convolution**. Implemented the paper [Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092).
