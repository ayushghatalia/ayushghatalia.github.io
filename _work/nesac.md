<-- Part of a 7-member team. Developed and tested an ML algorithm to predict rainfall in north eastern states of India. Integrated Pytorch with the python API of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform for data extraction/analytics. Implemented a UNET and an LSTM model tailored for rainfall prediction after literature review of some related papers. Tried various optimisers with different learning rates, used batch normalisation and kaiming initialisation to reduce losses and plotted the R2/RMSE losses and worked on accuracy metrics. -->
